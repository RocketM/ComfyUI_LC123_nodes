"""
LC Speed Boost (BETA): starts the render at half size, then grows it to full size partway through, so the early steps
cost about a quarter as much. The layout is decided while the picture is small (like the model's own trained size), the
detail at full size. Roughly 1.5x to 2x faster first passes on Krea 2, Z-Image and Flux.2 Klein, with the same quality,
and about 1.4x on SDXL, Pony and Illustrious.

Based on SPEED, "Spectral Progressive Diffusion for Efficient Image and Video Generation" (Xiao, Chao, Yariv and
Wetzstein, 2026), and the MIT licensed ComfyUI-SPEED-SwarmNeo. This is LC's own version: it runs on the GPU, it always
grows to full size before the last steps, and it steps aside where it can't help.

How the grow works (flow models: x = (1 - t) * picture + t * noise): the noise is shrunk by keeping the low part of its
cosine spectrum (still pure noise, same strength). At the grow point the small state is padded back to full size in the
same spectrum and the new fine part is filled with fresh noise. Padding leaves the picture 1/r as strong as the noise
(r = full size / small size, per side), so the state is scaled by k = r / (1 + (r - 1) * t) and sampling carries on at
the matching noise level k * t.
SDXL family (x = picture + sigma * noise): the same padding, then the state is scaled by r and sampling carries on at
r * sigma. Its switch point is set on the same 0..1 scale (t = sigma / (1 + sigma)) and sits a little later (0.6).
